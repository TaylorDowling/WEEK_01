### WEEK 01 LECTURE NOTES
* Create text files with your reflections weekly (always use .md files)
* Classifying failures can help us assess and give critical distance to better function in the future
  * Croxall and Warnick essay on failure in the humanities
  * Outlines four types of failures
    * Technical failures
    * Human failures
    * Failure as artifact
    * Failure as epistemology
  * Classifies failure as a means of expecting and accepting eventual failure; and that failure is able to be amended or explored 
* Students are narrowed into a certain expectation of procedure that limits the ability to experiment 
* Failure needs to be shared and explored openly to be of use

### GITHUB/MARKDOWN 
* Upload notes and reflections for this week (always use .md files)  
* Markdown tags
  * Hashtag for header one, double for header two, etc.
  * Bracketing with * or _ will make text italic
  * ** and _ _ (no space) will make text bold
    * Can be combined ( __like *this*__ )
  * Asterix to create a bulleted list 
      * Tab + * for sub items
  * Greater than symbol for block quotes 
  * (Do not fully understand how images works (maybe make a private rep to see how everything works better)

### HYPOTHES.IS
* Use for creating annotations/sharing info with others
* Have mainly used this for highlighting 

### ZOTERO
* Clicking browser icon will save key information for citing sources (you can add/edit if necessary)
  * Remember to sync
* Can take sources directly online, but you can also upload PDFs and download metadata 
  * Not everything seemed to import properly when bringing in PDFs, try to upload more later and test what files tend to work

### ‘RETURNING WOMEN TO THE HISTORY OF DIGITAL HISTORY’
* Narratives of early digital history often omit the contributions of women 
  * Susan Hockey’s “History of Humanities Computing”
  * Kathryn Kish Scalar and Thomas Dublin’s “Women in Social Movements in the United States, 1775-2000)
* More recent reviews of the field tend reproduce similar narratives rather than making amends to it; only further solidifying that “the history of digital history is a settled one—one that is devoid of women”
* However brief surveys prove that this is not the case
  * Kalani Craig’s use of text mining in medieval studies, Sharon Block’s computational analysis of early American gender dynamics, Michelle Moravec’s studies of women’s culture, or Kathryn Tomasek’s on financial records
  * Nicole Coleman, Paula Findlen, Miriam Posner, Janice Reiff, Sheila Brennan, Jennifer Rosenfeld, Kelly Schrum, Jennifer Guiliano, Anny Whisnant, Elissa Frankle, Priya Chhaya, etc.
* The neglect of these contributions are likely not intentional; we need to explore what leads to this erasure to ensure it doesn't carry forward
  * Structural academic forces may be a factor; slowing of women in leadership, focus on project directors over other contributions, focus on academic over non-academic participants, and the grouping of contributions all play a role in this erasure

### ‘HISTORY CAN BE OPEN SOURCE: DEMOCRATIC DREAMS AND THE RISE OF DIGITAL HISTORY’
* Exploration of Rosenzweig’s article “Can History Be Open Source?”
  * Rise of WIkipedia as the most widely spread free historical resource, in spite of its repelling of academics for its open access and uneven reliability 
  * Despite Rosenzweig’s positive comparison to encyclopedias and other studies, Wikipedia still spoils much discussions of openly sourced history (especially outside of the digital humanities
    * “If historians believe that what is available free on the Web is low quality, then we have a responsibility to make better information sources available online.”
  * Rather than constantly trying to edit Wikipedia we could learn from its strengths
* History has proved to be an open source in the 13 years since the paper’s publication
  * Article hopes to provide a critical evaluation of OER’s within academia 
  * Analysis of the founding values and short history of the digital history movement 
* Digital humanities as a means of democratizing history and creating new forms of scholarship/accessibility 
* But what does ‘democracy’ mean in the context of our digital sphere? 
  * Must be redefined under each new generation

### AMALIA SKARLATOU LEVI THREAD
* What is open and digitized for ease of access is only ever a portion of what is truly out there 
  * Digitized items should also be contextualised through collective aids
    * Offers nuanced information and aligns items alongside other relevant pieces or background information
* Sources
  * Proceedings of the Old Bailey; full collection of what survives of the 1676-1772 Bailey proceedings, including trial notes and biographical details of those executed at Tyburn
    * User is warned that information was often omitted during recording, and a full understanding requires supplemental sources 
  * 19th Century Concord Digital Archive; “aims to redefine assumptions about Concord writers by stressing relationships with marginalized groups” as may not often be noted in popular documentation
  * Digital Transgender Archive; explores transgender history, but cautions that difficulty with recording comes with the interpretation of identity
  * Orlando Project; focus on gender with aim to recover lost female authors 
  * Early Caribbean Digital Archive; filling in of gaps while also disrupting and reviewing the ‘knowledge regime of coloniality’
  * In Her Own Right; dives in female civil liberties, emphasises the archival issue of gaps and omissions ‘as a statement unto itself, leaving some voices unrecoverable”
  * South Asian Digital Archive; uses tech to create a more inclusive digital history
  * Palestinian Museum Digital Archives; first major project hoping to create a digital preservation of Palestinian history from otherwise endangered archives
  * Plateau People’s Web Portal; collaborative project self curated by representatives of the community so that they have the chance to control perceptions of them
  * Digital Archive of the Guatemalan National Police; emphasis of misstatements and lies on record as tools of repressive regimes, and urges users to be considerate of inaccuracies 
  * Mapping and Reconstructing Mau Mau Camps; archive of digital reconstructions/maps of Kenyan detention camps from oral, physical and archival evidence
  * Delis Negron Digital Archives; emphasises archival practises to remedy historical gaps of marginalized representation
  * Livingstone Online; acknowledges the inherent archival basis of colonial recording
