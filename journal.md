REFLECTIONS WEEK 01

* I hope to more effectively use the resources already at my disposal through some of the extensions we’ve already begun to use, as well as find some new ones to use in the future
  * I also hope to get better at using group resources and interacting more openly with peers (I usually stick to resources where I can work independently which probably just ends up limiting me)
* Bookmarked and checked out most of the sources from Amalia Skarlatou Levi’s thread (spent a particularly long period of time reading periodicals/zines from Digital Transgender Archive in particular) 
* Downloaded Zotero and tried it out by saving/citing some sources for other courses
  * Also tried uploading some older sources I had saved (Only about half uploaded at all and then only a handful were able to retrieve data)
    * Articles/books from Jstor work fine; tried some readings from the Met and catalogues didn’t seem to import properly, only chapters from larger publications seemed to
* Took notes from the readings on docs prior to downloading hypothes.is (oops), so I didn’t take any notations in the group, but I did experiment with it while reading articles for other classes
  * I added the notes from reading to the end of my notes page 
Largely been using the highlighter tool, but annotating will be good for finding additional information/making notes for annotated bibliographies later down the line
* If you have any notes in terms of adding more photos/notes/links/etc please let me know! I’m not as used to more open ended/exploratory assignments so I’m a little nervous about meeting standards
